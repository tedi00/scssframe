# Small SCSS Pseudo-Framework (SSPF)

Designed to keep larger projects with multiple developers clean and consistent
despite them all writing styles instead of using ready-made classes.

Comes with simple separation of concerns, ease of use, and most importantly,
less thinking required for devs.

* Configure colors and variables
* Read through `util-mixins`
* Check `component-mixins` if your generic component is there, if not, create
* Add mixins you need and other custom styles to your semantic CSS classes

All you need is an understanding of CSS.
